Scripts and aliases for Hadoop development.

Add something like the following to your bashrc to use them:

export HDEV=/home/eli/src/play/hadoop-dev
. $HDEV/bin/hadoop-alias.sh
export PATH=$HDEV/bin:$HDEV/test:$PATH

Edit HADOOP_SRC_ROOT in $HDEV/bin/hadoop-home.sh to point to the 
root directory where you keep your source trees.

Run the daemons, eg

    nn1 - Run the namenode daemon out of the first tree
    dn1 - " datanode
    jt1 - " jobtracker
    tt1 - " tasktracker


Execute commands, eg

    format-namenode 1

    hadoop1 fs -put temp temp0

    hadoop1 dfsadmin -safemode leave

    . /home/eli/src/play/hadoop-dev/bin/hadoop-home.sh 1
    J=$HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME/build/hadoop-mapred-examples-0.23.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
    hadoop1 jar $J pi 2 100000
